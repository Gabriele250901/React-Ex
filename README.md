# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Exercise7
Modify the Welcome component so that the Age component is rendered only if the age prop is greater than 18.

Exercise8
Modify the Welcome component so that the Age component is rendered only if the age prop is present.

Exercise9
Modify the Welcome component so that the Age component is rendered only if the age prop is greater than 18 and less than 65.

Exercise9
Modify the Welcome component so that the Age component is rendered only if the age prop is greater than 18 and less than 65 and the name prop is equal to "John".

Exercise11
Modify the Age component so that the "Your age is " message is rendered only if the age prop is greater than 18. Otherwise render the "You are very young!" message.

Exercise12
Create a Counter class component with an internal state containing a count property, initialized to 0. The Counter component should render the count property within an h1 tag, and the count property should be incremented by 1 every second;

Exercise13
Modify the Counter component so that the initial value of the counter, the increment interval and the increment amount are passed as props to the component.

Exercise14
Extract the h1 tag showing the count state variable into a new component called CounterDisplay and render it within the Counter component, passing it the count state variable as a prop.

Exercise15
Modify the Counter component so that the interval is initialized within the componentDidMount life cycle method instead of the constructor. Is the constructor still required? Il constructor e` required perche' nella documentazione continuano a lasciarlo quindi credo ne abbia bisogno, pero' l'operazione di did mount va eseguita fuori.
